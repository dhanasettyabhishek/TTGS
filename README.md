Time Table Generation System

Timetabling is the allocation, subject to constraints, of given resources to objects in space-time domain to satisfy a set of desirable objectives as nearly as possible. Particularly, the university timetabling problem for courses can be viewed as fixing in time and space a sequence of meetings between instructors and students, while simultaneously satisfying several various essential conditions or constraints.

Timetabling is a common example of a scheduling problem and can manifest itself in several different forms. The form of timetable required is specific to the environment or institutions in which it is needed.

The model takes advantage of the structural properties of conflict graph 
instances that arise from university timetabling problems, and is based on the effectiveness of a variety of graph colouring approaches. These are intelligently-ordered and intelligently-searched sequential colouring methods, as well as integer and constraint programming formulations of graph colouring in solving such problems.

Planning timetables is one of the most complex and error-prone applications. There are still serious problems occurring and these problems are repeating frequently. Therefore, there is a great requirement for an application distributing the courses evenly and without collisions. Graph colouring algorithm is one of the most used algorithms.
